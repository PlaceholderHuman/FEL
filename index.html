    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      The Free-Electron Laser (FEL) is a versatile and powerful light source with tunable wavelengths, enabling applications across fields such as atomic and molecular physics, biology, chemistry, particle physics, and astrophysics. John Madey, the inventor of the FEL, established this lab within the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. The lab houses a linear electron accelerator and an FEL oscillator, which produces infrared photons. These photons are used in an inverse Compton scattering configuration to generate hard X-ray photons.
