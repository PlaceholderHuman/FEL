    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      A Free Electron Laser is a powerful radiation amplifying tool with many different applications. For example, it can be used as a research tool for studying on a molecular level, with a wide range of tunable wavelengths, or as a high-intensity laser for defense.

    <h3>Current Goals</h3>
    <p>Because the FEL has been inoperative since 2016, several vacuum leaks have been sprung, and parts have worn from time. Currently, we are working to fix four different vacuum leaks. A new electron gun (thermionic) has already been produced.</p>

    <h3>Project Lead</h3>
    <p>
      The lead of the research project is Siqi Li, an assistant Professor to Niels Bidault and graduate from Stanford University with office at WAT 206
