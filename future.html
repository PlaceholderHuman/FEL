    <h2>Future</h2>
    <h3>3D Simulations</h3>
    <p>An undergrad research assistant would help code a 3d beam simulation and add a third mirror in order to get correlated spectroscopy. This third mirror would provide interference back into the original loop.
    </p>
    <h3>Superradiance regime</h3>
    <p>The electron emission? is increasing over time, where time is also decreasing. This creates high-intensity, short pulses of beam.
    </p>
    <h3>Beam Shaping</h3>
    <p>By shaping the beam, we can make a smoother distribution of electrons. The current control center is very tedious to make small changes to the beam shape, so we are hoping to cut that time and effort with machine learning.
