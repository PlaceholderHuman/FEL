    <h2>History of the FEL</h2>
    <p class = "para1">Professor John Madey (1943-2016) developed and built the first FEL in 1971 at Stanford University. He eventually came to work at UHM (1998-2016), and built his own FEL in Watanabe Hall. This FEL is the one that we are finally rebuilding.
    </p>
    <!--
    <p>
      His work led to the development of the SLAC in Stanford University in California, the SACLA in RIKEN SPring-8 in Japan, and the FLASH from DESY in Germany.
